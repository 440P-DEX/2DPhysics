# Project Overview

This repository hosts the development of a physics engine implemented in C++ and powered by SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). The project aims to create a robust and efficient engine capable of simulating basic physics principles.

# Note that

I am actaully new to game development, so my code could be a garbage... If you got any feedback for improvement, I would appreciate that!

I am also new to Github and I am now leaning how to use git properly.
